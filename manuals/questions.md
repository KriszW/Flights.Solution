## Requirement

- Do you want the see the flights aggregated into one table with the airport name at the end of each column, or you want to see it one-by-one, or both?
- What do you mean by live? Does it have to be real-time? Or is it enough to just update it when the user clicks a button or something like that?
- What you want to see on the frontend page? Is it enough to just print out the same data as the two example sites do (AIRLINE, FLIGHTNUMBER, DUE, FROM, STATUS) or something else?
- What does the "local display purposes" exactly mean?

## Implementation

- Does the frontend can be a Desktop APP or only a Web?
- Is it okay to do it in Blazor or any preferred technologies?
- Does the  https://www.heathrow.com/arrivals and https://www.london-luton.co.uk/flights sites has an API that i have to use or any documentation that i can use to get the data, or a service i can use for that?
- You want me to store the data or just query it everytime (like a gateway)?
- What version of dotnet should I use? (i would prefer 6.0)


## Testing
- What type of tests are required if any? (Frontend tests, unit tests, end-to-end tests, integration tests, mutation tets, load tests...)

## Deployment
- Could I Use a docker?
